# Code Comparison Rules


<rule>
name: code_comparison_accuracy
description: Enforces accurate reporting of code changes and metrics
auto_attach: true  

filters:
  - type: event
    pattern: "code_comparison|code_modification|code_analysis"

actions:
  - type: enforce
    conditions:
      - Before making any quantitative statements about code changes:
        1. Count the exact number of lines in the original file
        2. Count the exact number of lines in the modified file
        3. Calculate the exact difference and percentage change
        4. Use precise language when reporting changes
        5. Include the method used for counting (e.g., lines of code, including/excluding blank lines, comments, etc.) {{ CLARIFIED counting method }}

      - When discussing code optimizations:
        1. Specify which parts of the code were modified
        2. Provide exact metrics for the changes
        3. Avoid approximate numbers unless explicitly stated as estimates
        4. If estimating, clearly label it as an estimate and explain the basis

      - For partial file comparisons:
        1. Explicitly state that only a portion is being compared
        2. Specify the line ranges being compared
        3. Note any context that might be missing

examples:
  - incorrect: "The code is now about 35% shorter"
  - correct: "The code was reduced from 423 to 312 lines (26.2% reduction), including blank lines and comments"

  - incorrect: "~160 lines from ~400 lines"
  - correct: "Original: 412 lines, Modified: 385 lines (27 lines removed, 6.5% reduction)"

validation:
  - Verify all numbers before stating them
  - Double-check calculations
  - Use exact counts rather than approximations
  - Include the basis for any metrics provided
  - Validate the calculation of percentage change for accuracy {{ ADDED percentage change validation }}
