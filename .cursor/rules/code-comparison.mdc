# Code Comparison Rules

Enforces accurate reporting of code changes and metrics.

<rule>
name: code_comparison_accuracy
description: Enforces accurate reporting of code changes and metrics.
auto_attach: true
filters:
  - type: event
    pattern: "code_comparison|code_modification|code_analysis"

actions:
  - type: enforce
    conditions:
      - Before making any quantitative statements about code changes:
        1. Count the exact number of lines in the original file.
        2. Count the exact number of lines in the modified file.
        3. Calculate the exact difference and percentage change.
        4. Use precise language when reporting changes.
        5. Include the method used for counting.

      - When discussing code optimizations:
        1. Specify which parts of the code were modified.
        2. Provide exact metrics for the changes.
        3. Avoid approximate numbers unless explicitly stated as estimates.

      - For partial file comparisons:
        1. Explicitly state that only a portion is being compared.
        2. Specify the line ranges being compared.
        3. Note any context that might be missing.

examples:
  - incorrect: "The code is now about 35% shorter"
  - correct: "The code was reduced from 423 to 312 lines (26.2% reduction), including blank lines and comments."
