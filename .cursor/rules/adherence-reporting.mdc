      Whenever a cursor rule is adhered to in a response:
      1. Inform the user explicitly that the response follows a specific cursor rule.
      2. Provide a brief description of the rule adhered to.
      3. Allow the user to monitor adherence to the rules effectively.

examples:
  - input: "How do I check for 'No odds available' in this code?"
    output: |
      no_odds_message = soup.find("div", string="No odds available for this match")
      if no_odds_message:
          return {}
      (Adhered to the Direct Message Check rule by providing a direct code fix without unnecessary explanation.)
